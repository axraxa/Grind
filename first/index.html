        <h1 class="blogh1">Motherboard</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp; Moterboard(MoBo) is a thing where we put every pc part(CPU, GPU , RAMs , HDD , e.t.c.)
          and they connect (to each other) through MoBo . Motherboards have generations which are
          DDR1 , DDR2 , DDR3 , DDR4 and DDR5 ,from which DDR1 and DDR2 are outdated(very old to use),
          DDR3 is old too but still usable for low end pcs , DDR4 is new and DDR5 is newest generation
          (which is logically the best option).

        <h1 class="blogh1">CPU</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp; CPU is part of the pc which processes everyhing that's going on our computer.If we want
          our pc to render (images or videos or even games) fast we need to have strong (not outdated)
          CPU . There is two big companies which manufactures them (Intel and Amd) , nowadays market 
          is so big that they are always,almost even (performance wise), but in the old days amd was falling
          back.So u can choose whatever company's CPU u want to buy(bias AMD better).

        <h1 class="blogh1">GPU</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp; GPU is PC part which  we can say paints everything on desktop, for example if you are 
          playing online-competetive game called CSGO  and throw a smoke , that smoke pixels
          are drawn by GPU , CPU does it too but GPU is better at painting , making things
          beautiful more than CPU would.In GPU market there is also 2 big companies but AMD and 
          Nvidia ,Intel manifactures GPUs too but they are not as high level as amd's and nvidia's. 
          When you are choosing GPU you must consider

           to get best performance from your built PC.

      <div class="blogpost">
        <h1 class="blogh1">RAM</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp; RAM (random-access memory) is essentially short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it.
          To explain it easily , ram helps you to open 20tabs on google chrome , if you have not much RAM GBs
          to open 20tabs of google your PC will start laging,it will slow down and you will not be able to experience (for example) 
          watching youtube at best performance your pc can do.

      <img src="imgs/ps.jpg" class="blogimg">
      <div class="blogpost">
        <h1 class="blogh1">PSU</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp;  PSU(power supply unit) connects on motherboard as every part of the PC , we connect our computer
          to electricity by PSU and everything connected on MoBo gets energy from it.So we can say that 
          every PC part needs each other , because without psu they won't be able to power on , without 
          ram and cpu you won't be able to run computer , as without hard drive or ssd because you can't run
          computer without 
          <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS" target="_blank">operating system (OS)</a> 
           and it must be on hdd or ssd.

        <h1 class="blogh1">SSDs and HDDs</h1>
        <p class="blogp">
          &nbsp;  HDD(Hard-drive-disk) and SSD(solid-state-drive) is just memory which contains our pc data and
          operating system . HDDs are slow but they are cheap and we can buy  1TB HDD for 120gb SSD for example.
          SSDs are more expensive than HDDs but they are way faster and it loads everything going on computer 
          very fast. There are 2 types of SSDs on market which are Nvme and Sata , Nvme SSD gets placed on 
          motherboard and is faster than sata SSD,on the other hand we can connect Sata SSD  to motherboard 
          by cable(still sata SSD is faster than any HDD).

        &nbsp; This Website is made for learning purposes only and its non-professional.Once newbie web
        developer (Named Axraxa) who's skills were only HTML and CSS was thinking what project he should have done,
        at final he came to conclusion that he must do one page website which people will use (for good)
        and demonstrates his skills at HTML and CSS . So he made this Web where people can see his skills 
        and understand how PC parts work (simply, because they are simply explained , non-professional).
